## What is Open CoDesign?

Open CoDesign turns a natural-language prompt into a polished HTML prototype, slide deck, or marketing asset — entirely on your laptop, with whichever AI model you already pay for. Think of it as Claude Design, minus the subscription lock-in, minus the cloud account, minus the single-model ceiling.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install

**Package managers** (recommended):

```sh
# macOS — Homebrew
brew tap OpenCoworkAI/tap
brew install --cask open-codesign

# Windows — winget
winget install OpenCoworkAI.open-codesign

# Windows — Scoop
scoop bucket add opencowork https://github.com/OpenCoworkAI/scoop-bucket
scoop install opencowork/open-codesign
```

**Direct download** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/OpenCoworkAI/open-codesign/releases):

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `open-codesign-*-arm64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel) | `open-codesign-*.dmg` |
| Windows (x64 / arm64) | `open-codesign-*-setup.exe` |
| Linux | `open-codesign-*.AppImage` |

> **v0.1 note:** installers are unsigned. macOS: right-click → Open, or run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/open-codesign.app` after install. Windows: SmartScreen → More info → Run anyway.
> Want a verified build? Compile from source — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### 2. Add your API key

First launch opens the Settings page. Paste any provider key:

- Anthropic (`sk-ant-…`)
- OpenAI (`sk-…`)
- Google Gemini
- Any OpenAI-compatible relay (OpenRouter, SiliconFlow, local Ollama)

Credentials stay in `~/.config/open-codesign/config.toml`, encrypted via Electron `safeStorage`. Nothing leaves your machine.

### 3. Type your first prompt

Pick one of **fifteen built-in demos** — landing page, dashboard, pitch slide, pricing, mobile app, chat UI, event calendar, blog article, receipt/invoice, portfolio, settings panel, and more — or describe your own. A sandboxed prototype appears in seconds.

## Built-in Anthropic-style design intelligence

Generic AI tools produce generic output. Open CoDesign ships with **twelve built-in design skill modules** — slide decks, dashboards, landing pages, SVG charts, glassmorphism, editorial typography, heroes, pricing, footers, chat UIs, data tables, and calendars — plus an **anti-AI-slop design Skill** that steers the model toward considered typography, purposeful whitespace, and meaningful color, not `#3B82F6` blue buttons on every artifact.

Every skill is already in every generation. Before the model writes a line of CSS, it picks the right skill for the brief and reasons through layout intent, design-system coherence, and contrast — the same editorial discipline behind Claude Design's best outputs, available on any model you bring.

Add a `SKILL.md` to any project to teach the model your own taste.

## What's working today

- **Unified provider model** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, SiliconFlow, local Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible relay; keyless (IP-allowlisted) proxies supported
- **One-click import** from Claude Code and Codex configs — bring your existing providers, models, and keys in a single click
- **Dynamic model picker** — every provider exposes its real model catalogue, not a hardcoded shortlist
- **Prompt → HTML or JSX/React component** prototype, rendered in a sandboxed iframe (vendored React 18 + Babel on-device)
- **Fifteen built-in demos + twelve design skill modules** — ready-to-edit starting points for every common design brief
- **Live agent panel** — watch tool calls stream in real time as the model edits files
- **AI-generated sliders** — the model emits the parameters worth tweaking (color, spacing, font); drag to refine with zero round-trip
- **Comment mode** — click any element in the preview to drop a pin, leave a note, model rewrites only that region
- **Phone / tablet / desktop preview** — true responsive frames, switch with one click
- **Files panel** — inspect multi-file artifacts (HTML, CSS, JS) before export
- **Instant design switching** — the last five designs keep their preview iframes alive, so Hub ↔ Workspace and sidebar navigation stay zero-delay
- **Connection diagnostic panel** — one-click test for any provider, with actionable errors
- **Light + dark themes**, **EN + 简体中文 UI** with live toggle
- **Five export formats** — HTML (inlined CSS), PDF (local Chrome), PPTX, ZIP, Markdown
- **Generation cancellation** — stop mid-stream without losing prior turns
- **Settings with four tabs** — Models (providers + keys), Appearance (theme/language), Storage (config + data paths), Advanced (update channel)
- **GitHub Release pipeline** — signed DMG (macOS), EXE (Windows), AppImage (Linux)
